# GDSC Backend

### Requirements

* having .net 6.0 installed on your machine

### Setup

* Open [how-to-database] and learn how to connect to our database

* Next, here in Rider, copy-paste `template.appsettings.Development.json` to `appsettings.Development.json` (make sure
  you DO NOT
  delete `template.appsettings.Development.json`)

* Good. Now we should tell our application which database to use. Open [appsettings.Development.json]
  and change the following values from the default connection string:
    * `myDataBase` with your database name(in our case it's `bill-gates-gdsc`)
    * `myPassword` with `someparolÄƒ`

* To be able to work with the database, we need to install .NET Entity Framework Core Tools by running in the terminal
  the next command: `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef`

* Great! Next we should create database tables by running `dotnet ef database update`

* We're good to run our application! Type the following command: `dotnet watch run`

# Important notes!

* After you modify a model class (ExampleModel, ContactModel, etc) you must
  run `dotnet ef migrations add <insert some  name here>` and then `dotnet ef database update`
